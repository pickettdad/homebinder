# CLAUDE.md

HouseSteady Field Assistant — offline-first iPad inspection PWA. Orientation order:
`docs/REDESIGN-v2.md` (the model), `docs/PLAN-STAGE-0.md` / `docs/PLAN-STAGE-1.md`
(build plans), `docs/CHECKLIST-MASTER.md` (checklist content — owner-edited, versioned).

## Standing rules

**Owner reports — "For David" section.** Every report to the owner ends with a section
titled **For David**, written for a non-programmer: what changed in field/inspection
terms, what decisions are needed from him and in what plain-language form, and what
happens next. Technical detail goes above that section, never in it.

**Verification budget.** The owner budgets API and usage spend during the build.
Default to single-session work with self-review; do not launch multi-agent
workflows/fleets unless the owner explicitly opts in for a specific task. Quality
still ships: CI gates stay green, and claims are verified before they're reported.
(The in-product inspection AI is exempt — it earns money; pick the best working
option there.)

**Config discipline.** `src/config/checklists.generated.ts` is generated from
`docs/CHECKLIST-MASTER.md` (`npm run gen:checklists`) — never hand-edit it; CI fails
on drift. The master itself is edited by the owner's side, never unilaterally here;
defects become change-requests in `docs/CHECKLIST-MASTER-REVIEW.md`. Same rule as
`route.baseline.ts`: config is data, ids are never renamed or reused.
